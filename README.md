# assembler233
A simple assembler for a simple assembly language used for the CPU design project in KFUPM's ICS 233. Because I couldn't be bothered with assembling instructions by hand :D

# Usage
- Use the [online website](https://sleepy-falls-81898.herokuapp.com/).
- Use `file_assembler.py` to translate files (`python file_assembler.py test.asm`). See `file_assembler.py -h` for help.
Note: The main logic is in `assembler233.py`

# To-Do
- add unit tests
- handle faulty assembly and file paths properly
- test file_assembly.py on linux and mac
- optimize file io
